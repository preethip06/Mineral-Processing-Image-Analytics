Tasks performed on the given input images of minerals:
1. Found the smallest circle that just encapsulates the particle
2. Calculated the total surface area of the particle (in pixels)
3. Derived the major axis (longest axis) in the particle that lies entirely inside the particle (in pixels)
4. Calculated the Total perimeter of the particle (in pixels)
5. Derived the centroid of the particle
